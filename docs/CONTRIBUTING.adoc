== Re-baseline default versions

Tools have been added to the `buildSrc` to automate some aspects of source code modification/generation.
Some cases for this are:

* Latest Core LTS
* Latest published plugins
* Groovy version bundled in Core

`./gradlew runRebaseline` will execute all re-baseline tasks.

== Testing

`./gradlew build` will run all tests.
